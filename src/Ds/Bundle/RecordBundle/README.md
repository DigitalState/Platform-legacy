## Record Definition

Records represents accounts in writing preserving the knowledge of facts or events that occurred in the system. For example, the data of a user-submitted form, approval record created by managers or a receipt generated by a user action.

A record is a generic way for business users or processes to store snapshots of data in time.

## Record Creation

**Example**:

```php
<?php

namespace Gov\Bundle\DemoBundle\Controller;

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;

class DemoController extends Controller
{
    public function demoAction()
    {
        $manager = $this->get('ds.record.manager.record');
        $record = $manager->createEntity();
        $record
            ->setType('dog-license-application-review')
            ->setSource('gov-manager')
            ->setData([
                'request' => 'dog-license',
                'approved' => true
            ]);
        $om = $manager->getObjectManager();
        $om->persist($record);
        $om->flush();
    }
}
```
